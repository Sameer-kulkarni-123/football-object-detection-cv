# To see the immediate output of the model

The ```/model-outputs``` folder contains the final result generated by the model after processing the input video ```input-video/test2.mp4``` 


Youtube link to the final [output_video](https://youtu.be/Os81uQ5xtdg)

# To run the model on your own input video
## Download test data
You can download sample test videos from this [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saberghaderi/-dfl-bundesliga-460-mp4-videos-in-30sec-csv?resource=download)

## Download trained model weights
Download the model weights from [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CNWF2tNk88RKVnxDQeNuq5fox-QsE4Kv/view?usp=sharing)

Place the downloaded file under the ```/models``` folder

## Change  ```main.py``` 
In ```main.py``` in ```
  tracks = tracker.get_obj_tracks(video_frames, read_from_stub=True, stub_path="stubs/track_stub.pkl")``` change ```read_from_stub=False ```

This will make sure that new data is created and used rather than the cached old data

# To train your own model
use the notebook ```/training/football_training_yolo_v5.ipynb``` to train your own model

Its recommended to use Google Colab with a GPU

Get the Dataset Link to train the model from [Here](https://app.roboflow.com/sam-6tcdr/football-players-detection-3zvbc-f1yjq/1) : Select the format as ```YOLO v5 PyTorch``` and Select ```Show Download Code```

Replace the Code in the 2nd Cell with the download code

The weights of the Trained model will the available at ```/runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt``` after the execution

Place the weights ```best.pt``` under the ```/models``` folder
